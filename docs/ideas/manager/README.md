The manager is the main component of dis.io, This will act as the provider layer to the distributor. It will contain a RESTful API which will generate an optimised version of specific work-units and log to which ID each unit has been sent to and how many of those units have been sent.

The Manager will include possibly a web based / command-line management panel to be able to:

- Queue new work-units.
- Set deadlines for work-units.

The manager doesn't need to be online as it is only required when the distributer asks for a new task.
