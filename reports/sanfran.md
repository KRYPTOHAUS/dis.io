## San Francisco visit report

With my final year project based on distributed computing systems, scalability in my final project will be playing a major role. I decided to go to the Node Summit Conference [1]; The main concept behind this was to discus how people are using certain technologies in enterprise / large software systems generally using Node.JS [2].

Apart from being able to hear talks from big players in the industry; VMware, Microsoft, Rackspace. It also enabled me to talk to them and discuss various aspects of my project and to confirm or deny whether it is a good way of talking various problems.

The main learning outcomes from this trip is how soft real-time machine to machine communications are an important factor in new systems, and that more technologies and software packages are striving to accomplish this.
